# build-my-own

`build-my-own` is a CLI tool for `Build Your Own X`. It clones a GitHub project and sets up cursor rules, so that you can make AI guide you to rebuild the project from the ground up. Through rebuilding a version of your own, I believe that you can better understand the project.

## usage

Install:

```shell
npm i -g build-my-own
```

Run:

> The following command creates a new directory in current pwd with the name of the project.

```shell
build-my-own <github-url>
```
